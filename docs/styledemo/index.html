<p>Sex in Public by Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner explores the concept of queer culture as world-making and counter-publics, which functions as a form of resistance against heteronormative powers and rules of intimacy. This counter-public against institutional powers and diversionary lines explores the power dynamic between public versus private sex acts that develop based on relationships, cultures, and communities only recognized in intimate and close queer communities separate from any relation to domestic spaces, collective nationhood, and property (Berlant &amp; Warner, 558). Berlant and Warner write,</p>

<p>Berlant and warner explain through these shared intimacies and spaces that the world-making project forms by acknowledging the different facets in which queer culture forms outside public opinion and state power or even sexuality. Instead, through this counter-public that queer culture is developed through relationships and narratives of intimacy and sexualization found only in queer spaces. One example Berlant and Warner give is describing the act of public vomiting in a sex club. The counter-public rejects the heteronormative private and public diversionary lines when the audience participates in collective intimacy in the event. The audience cannot look away; while the audience does not join in and vomit, they are part of the act, a collective participant in the intimate moment, whistling, stomping and moaning as the climatic vomiting ensues, forming a queered counter-public independent from heteronormative powers and domestic spaces (Berlant &amp; Warner, 558).
Berlant and Warner describe world-making as a counter-public that rejects heteronormative diversionary lines of public versus private. They argue because it was not just two people in an intimate act but everyone engaged in the intimate act with everyone else, the collective</p>
<h4>&quot;includes more people than can be identified, more spaces than can be mapped beyond a few reference points&quot; (Berlant &amp; Warner, 558)</h4>

<p>Queer counter-publics are an example of resistance to power by redefining the dividing line between public and private; the counter-public also creates a community based on shared principles, challenging heteronormative powers by creating through sex acts that</p>
<h4>‚Äúsupport forms of affective, erotic and personal living that are public in the sense of accessible, available to memory, and sustained through collective activity‚Äù (Berlant &amp; Warner, 562)</h4>
<p><img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1280/azure/dazed-prod/1250/6/1256596.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The world-making project, described by Berlant and Warner, acts as a counter-public by rejecting heteronormative powers in its rejection and questioning the private versus public.</p>

<p>Fashion can operate as a form of queer world-making, producing a queer counterpublic visible to heteronormative powers while remaining independent from heteronormative institutional powers and diversionary lines distinct from domestic spaces, collective nationhood, and property. Fashion is everything; it is a conscious choice you make when putting it on your body while simultaneously being unconscious chooses for you from a larger industrial complex. Whatever form it may come in as art, Avante-Garde, or drag, fashion and design is everywhere, and nobody is exempt; as Miranda Priestly (The Devil Wears Prada) describes the function of fashion best,</p>

<p>Like sex, fashion functions as a form of resistance, fluid in nature and untraceable, mapped beyond a few reference points. As much as it can assimilate it, fashion can also &quot; unsettle the garbled but powerful norms supporting that privilege-including the project of normalization that has made heterosexuality hegemonic&quot; (Berlant &amp; Warner 548). As Foucault argues, where there is power, there is resistance; fashion can give clarity to self-identity in these mobile counter publics mediated by the public. Fashion exists as a Berlant and Warner describe a</p>
