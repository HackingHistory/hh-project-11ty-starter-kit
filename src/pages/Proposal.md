# Topic Description 
This project will explore how Eastern European indie fashion designers and queer rave subcultures generate an international queer revolution using public forums such as Instagram. I will be primarily be looking at Russian and Ukrainian fashion and their impact on sites like Instagram, I-D, and Vogue. Additionally, I would like to create 2-3 pages including traditional academic information/theory. A second page prioritizes Instagrams, articles, and websites links to different fashion brands. And a third comparative page that has a timeline of different Queer Fashion revolutions from the early years of vogue, the queer liberation movement, to contemporary Eastern Europe.

# Audience
The intended audience for this project is Queer youth who are interested in fashion, activism, and rave/EDM culture. I believe while this project focuses on the experiences of queer Ukrainians and Russians, this material can be consumable by people regardless of their geographical location. The Calvert Journal (a resource I will draw on regularly) supports this argument. While the journal focuses on eastern Europe, it is available internationally through digital publications. In addition, the journal is published in English and written by journalists from all over eastern Europe. Therefore, I don't feel there will be a serious language barrier with the project. 

# Structure Outline
 The website will have one main page structurally and be broken up into three sub-pages. The main page will hold the about/introduction information, information about myself (possibly), some images, and a brief overview of what the rest of the website holds. 
 - The first sub-page will hold my thesis and a more traditional academic exploration. It will analyze the data and support the thesis introduced on the main page.   
 - The second sub-page will house images and external digital media such as Instagram posts journal and magazine entries. This page will also be full of links to the different fashion houses mentioned in the first sub-page.
 - The Third sub-page will be a timeline detailing some of the critical queer rights moments. Additionally, I will be showing maps both during Soviet Russia and post-soviet Russia for those unfamiliar with Eastern European geography.
