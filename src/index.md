The war between the USSR and Nazi Germany was one of the bloddiest conflicts in European history, and the site of multiple atrocities commited by both parties. 9/10 German casualties occured in this region, and millions of more Soviet soldiers were also killed.

The sheer scale of this conflict was not limited to bodies, but also to how large the front was itself. Hearing "1000 mile front" is difficult for people to conceptualize, similar to how casualty counts begin to lose meaning.
