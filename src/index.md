Title: Revolution Through Queer Fashion in Easter Europe
---

This site will explore how Russian queer counter-publics function and survive through fashion generating mobile spaces of queer world-making, producing a queer counterpublic visible to heteronormative powers while remaining independent from heteronormative institutional powers and diversionary lines distinct from domestic spaces, collective nationhood, and property. 

This site will look at the evolution from revolutionary Russia (18th-19th century) to contemporary Russian queer counter-publics. This site will look at 18th and 19th-century bathhouse culture as a mobile queer zone visible to the public but only recognizable to the gay (male) community. Additionally, this site will explore how fashion such as cross-dressing and drag part acted as an extension of early queer coding, subverting the hegemonic heteronormative systemic powers in revolutionary Russia.

This site will also explore how popular media through youtube and music competitions like Eurovision and fashion acts as a method of queer-world making, informing contemporary queer revolutions and rights activism using public forums such as Instagram to expand these mobile spaces transnationally across borders and languages. 

Finally, this site will look at how popular media through youtube and music competitions like Eurovision and fashion normalizes queer zones visible to heteronormative powers but only recognizable to queer sustained through collective activity.
