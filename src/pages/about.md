## Background 

This project was conceived in 2021 and my participation in Hacking History (HIS498gave me the opportunity to treat this idea as a serious study in the Digital Humanities. 

Hacking History equipped with the foundation knowledge in technology, data, to begin to think, plan, and develop projects for the Digital Humanities. 

The current stage of the project is exploratory and experimental. 

## Inspiration

For many Canadians, the concept of reconciliation is a matter of government policy. Fortunately, the movement towards reconciliation recieves ample news coverage and we can now see businesses and institutiions introduce ways to include indigenous lives into their work and operational cultures. These are important and necessary moves, but I wonder what the 'average' Canadian can do, on a human level, to connect with thier own past and make connections with indigenous commmunities.

<figcaption align = "left">The Friendship Belt, or The Covenant Chain belt, represents one of the earliest treaties between the Crown and First Nations peoples and established the foundation for First Nations - Crown relationships for generations thereafter. The belt shows that the Crown is linked by a chain to the First Nations peoples of this land. The three links of the chain represent a covenant of friendship, good minds, and the peace which shall always remain between us. The covenant chain is made of silver symbolizing that the relationship will be polished from time to time to keep it from tarnishing. This was the basis of the Nation to Nation relationship between the British Crown and the First Nations who became their allies in the formation of early Canada.
