## Topic

The Canadian Curriculum History Project (CCHP) seeks to explore the curriculum history of key and sometimes controversial subjects in Canadian public school curriculum.
The first initiative of the CCHP will be to examine the curriculum history of Indigenous peoples. This will include reviewing, documenting, and categorizing the depictions and representations of Indigenous peoples, cultures, and events in Canadian public school curriculum.

As Canadians begin to address and reconcile the past policies of their governments and institutions, it is critical to understand what role education played in disguising, distorting, omitting, and erasing historical events and patterns, including state and institutional crimes. This project will examine representation through this lense and connect and correlate government policy and programs.

## Audience and Stakeholders

At this time I do not have the requirements to submit a successful Master's application, but I would like to begin work on this project through a Senior Thesis or Independant Study. This, of course, will require the sponsorship and support of a faculty member. I would like to work with Matt Price, my instructor for Hacking History (HIS496H1).

For this project to be successful, and to improve my chances of a submitting a successful MA application, I will need to build a team of support including advisors and Subject Matter Experts. I envision needing the following people: 

* Project sponsor and advisor (Matt Price?)
* A curriculum history specialist (OISE)
* An education specialist (OISE)
* An Indigenous history scholar (UofT)
* A Canadian history scholar (UofT)
* A Canadian political history scholar (UofT)
* A Canadian policy/legislative historian

I will also connect with various history, government and indigenous organizations to build support for this project.
