## Topic Description 
This project will explore how Eastern European indie fashion designers and queer rave subcultures generate an international queer revolution using public forums such as Instagram. I will be primarily be looking at Russian and Ukrainian fashion and their impact on sites like Instagram, I-D, and Vogue. Additionally, I would like to create 2-3 pages including traditional academic information/theory. A second page prioritizes Instagrams, articles, and websites links to different fashion brands. And a third comparative page that has a timeline of different Queer Fashion revolutions from the early years of vogue, the queer liberation movement, to contemporary Eastern Europe.

## Audience
The intended audience for this project is Queer youth who are interested in fashion, activism, and rave/EDM culture. I believe while this project focuses on the experiences of queer Ukrainians and Russians, this material can be consumable by people regardless of their geographical location. The Calvert Journal (a resource I will draw on regularly) supports this argument. While the journal focuses on eastern Europe, it is available internationally through digital publications. In addition, the journal is published in English and written by journalists from all over eastern Europe. Therefore, I don't feel there will be a serious language barrier with the project. 

## Structure Outline
 The website will have one main page structurally and be broken up into three sub-pages. The main page will hold the about/introduction information, information about myself (possibly), some images, and a brief overview of what the rest of the website holds. 
 - The first sub-page will hold my thesis and a more traditional academic exploration. It will analyze the data and support the thesis introduced on the main page.   
 - The second sub-page will house images and external digital media such as Instagram posts journal and magazine entries. This page will also be full of links to the different fashion houses mentioned in the first sub-page.
 - The Third sub-page will again be a writing heavy page about Queer communities and right in Soviet Russia 

### Contemporary Fashion, Art and Activism: Uniting a Community Across Lines 
Although Queerness itself, such as sexuality, has not been criminalized since 1993 in Russia and 1991 in Ukraine, homosexuality, Queerness, and queer culture have largely disapproved, ostracized, policed and punished by the Russian and Ukrainian communities. 

Within Russian same-sex couples and families are not privy to the same social services, legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples. For example, the state does not recognize marriage between same-sex couples, nor are LGBTQ individuals protected against discrimination and hate crimes. Additionally, traditional forms of protest for Queer Rights such as organized public protest, government criticism, blockades, and marches most affiliated with the New York Gay Rights movement are not legal nor transposable within the Russian state or context. Since 2014, protests, freedom of assembly without government officials' expressed approval have been criminalized and punishable in Russia.
