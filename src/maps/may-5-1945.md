# 1945 - The Fall of the Reich
Depending on who you ask, World War II lasted for 4, 6, or even 14 years. For Europe, May 9th, 1945 marked the final day of war on the continent as the Soviet Union took Berlin. A soldier who had fought in the Battle of Moscow in the winter of 1941 and managed to survive until 1945 to end up in Berlin would have traveled around 1,130 miles (1,814 kilometers).
