<p>The Canadian Curriculum History Project (CCHP) seeks to explore the curriculum history of key and sometimes controversial subjects in Canadian public school curriculum.
The first initiative of the CCHP will be to examine the curriculum history of Indigenous peoples. This will include reviewing, documenting, and categorizing the depictions and representations of Indigenous peoples, cultures, and events in Canadian public school curriculum.</p>
<p>As Canadians begin to address and reconcile the past policies of their governments and institutions, it is critical to understand what role education played in disguising, distorting, omitting, and erasing historical events and patterns, including state and institutional crimes. This project will examine representation through this lense and connect and correlate government policy and programs.</p>

<p>At this time I do not have the requirements to submit a successful Master's application, but I would like to begin work on this project through a Senior Thesis or Independant Study. This, of course, will require the sponsorship and support of a faculty member. I would like to work with Matt Price, my instructor for Hacking History (HIS496H1).</p>
<p>Once approvals are obtained and project proposel completed, these support members will be approached to solicit their interest and/or support for the project. I will also connect with various history, government and indigenous organizations to build support for this project.</p>
<p>Reference Letters: Three letters of reference are required for UofT's MA History program and can hopefully be gleaned from the team members above.</p>

<h4>Building a Project Team</h4>
<p>For this project to be successful, and to improve my chances of a submitting a successful MA application, I will need to build a team of support including advisors and Subject Matter Experts. I envision needing the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project sponsor and advisor</li>
<li>Curriculum history specialist (OISE)</li>
<li>Education specialist (OISE)</li>
<li>Indigenous history scholar (UofT)</li>
<li>Canadian history scholar (UofT)</li>
<li>Canadian political history scholar (UofT)</li>
<li>Canadian policy/legislative historian</li>
<li>Technology advisor</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Stakeholders and Interested Parties</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> As the project takes form, I envion an aggressive publicity component to build support and awareness not only for the project itself but for Digital Humanities. Various websites and publications should be contacted with a releases and a project brief. The project subject matter is timely and newsworthy so with proper planning and support, it should get some traction.</li>

<p>As my mother and I began the painful process of sorting through my recently-deceased grandmotherâ€™s things, among the many silk scarves, countless photographs, and I came across an photo album of</p>
<p>As Canada now joins the exclusive club of counties who have committed genocide I wondered what is my responsibility as an the ancestor of settlers and pioneers.</p>
<p>As I think of my grandparents and others, who didnâ€™t know or didnâ€™t ask or didnâ€™t care to know, I think the greatest crime I can commit not following them by not asking or doing.</p>
<p>I then began to think about how I came to learn about First Nations. I had tacky trinkets and toys like headdresses, tomahawks, model teepees and birchbark canoes. I vaguely remember OKa ( I was thirteen).</p>
<p>For most of my life I have lived no more than 50 kilometres away from a reservation, but would mean not much more than a quick joke about cheap smokes or cheap gas.</p>
<p>It was not until my first year in university, when reading a peer-reviewed journal did I learn from an international observer that there west problems at home.</p>
<p>Of course I had read some Chomsky in grade 11 media studies (and continue to read him) talking about the American institution, but didnâ€™t turn that critical gaze towards Canada.</p>
<p>These experiences led me to the idea of studying what we learned in school and how that may operate to indoctrinate citizens.</p>
<p>I have always believed that every Canadian, whether the families of pioneers or new Canadians to at least ask what responsibility do we have.</p>
<p>Sure, we can leave institutional measures to the government, but what about at a human level, a community level. What can Canadians do to foster closer more integrated relations with our indigenous peoples?</p>
<p>Mighty glitchy, BeChcombers, mythologies in cub scouts</p>
<p>I recently learned of the silver cup of peace and Covenant. Is this something we can look to as those willing to listen and participate in creating a Canada that is aware and accepting of past and looking forward to a future.</p>
<p>As we move from awareness and acceptance, what might action look like? Can we leave to givenntbt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can leave reconciling to governments and politicians or we can create opportunities to make connections with other communities, learn from our history, work towards a more just future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About taking responsibility. We are citizens in a democratic society and ultimately have responsibility for actions of government.  So</p>
<p>As we almost weekly read about the discovery of new graves holding the remains of indigenous children, and as we, as a society begin to reconcile our colonial past, account for MMWIG, and watch as our governments and communities address the reconciliation process.</p>
<p>As I began to reflect on news and findings, I wondered what the responsability of citizens, of Canadian people, do we have. My thoughts turned to the idea of responsability as a vital component. But how do we think about ressponability. How do we envision responsability through the education system when information, narratives, histories, are denied to us. This is how I arrived at the idea for this project.</p>
