### Contemporary Fashion, Art and Activism: Uniting a Community Across Lines 
Although Queerness itself, such as sexuality, has not been criminalized since 1993 in Russia and 1991 in Ukraine, homosexuality, Queerness, and queer culture have largely disapproved, ostracized, policed and punished by the Russian and Ukrainian communities. 

Within Russian same-sex couples and families are not privy to the same social services, legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples. For example, the state does not recognize marriage between same-sex couples, nor are LGBTQ individuals protected against discrimination and hate crimes. Additionally, traditional forms of protest for Queer Rights such as organized public protest, government criticism, blockades, and marches most affiliated with the New York Gay Rights movement are not legal nor transposable within the Russian state or context. Since 2014, protests, freedom of assembly without government officials' expressed approval have been criminalized and punishable in Russia. 

Additionally, in 2013 Russia passed a "gay propaganda" law that acts as a political arm to suppress gay rights, education, and community online and physically. Members of parliament argue that the objective of the law is to "protect children" from finding information unnatural and immoral people and simultaneously champion "tradtional" family values and structures. 


However, Russian creatives have found a loophole to these laws through international social media giants such as Instagram as a way to network across borders, organizations with the capacity to attract thousands of people. Moreover, social media does not follow the same political lines or organizations; this allows the collaboration and networking between cultural leaders, artistic creatives, political activists, and the unassociated queer population to connect on the commonality of queer. 

As pop and EDM culture and the age of television and the internet popularized, the ability to find queer iconographies and symbols across Russia has never been more accessible and, most crucial, transportable across borders and language barriers. Artists (while not queer) like Russian pop duo T.aT.u and 2007 Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Verka Serduchka have become transnational icons of queerness transnationally despite neither being queer. Russian pop duo T.aT.u Lena Katina and Julia Volkova released the Queer cult classic "All the Things She Said" in 2002, rising in the charts and landing their late-night debut on the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.

"All the Things She Said" became a queer anthem accompanied by nearly pornographic performances while singing live and queer baiting in the music video. However, despite Katin and Volkova being heterosexual and anti-LGBTQ, they have become complicated international queer cult legends in both Russia and America, spurring conversations on rights and freedom in both countries in a time where queer visibility in mainstream media was a rare sight and only a few years following Ellen coming out. Vice journalist Daisy Jones sums up the complicated status of "All the Things She Said" as a facilitator of queer mobile zones and world-making writing, 

#### "I'm imbuing "All the Things She Said" with an excessive sentimentality here. Honestly, listen back to it now – it fucking slaps – and it also offered us actual queer girls the opportunity to reframe a marketing ploy into something powerful in the process – in spite of Volkova's blatant, wince-worthy homophobia. And while this band are so far from being queer icons (please!), the post-Trump need for girls making out in the rain to the sound of some freaky rock-trance hybrid has never been greater. I, for one, am here for it."
