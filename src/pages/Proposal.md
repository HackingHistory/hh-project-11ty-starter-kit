### Contemporary Fashion, Art and Activism: Uniting a Community Across Lines 
Although Queerness itself, such as sexuality, has not been criminalized since 1993 in Russia and 1991 in Ukraine, homosexuality, Queerness, and queer culture have largely disapproved, ostracized, policed and punished by the Russian and Ukrainian communities. 

Within Russian same-sex couples and families are not privy to the same social services, legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples. For example, the state does not recognize marriage between same-sex couples, nor are LGBTQ individuals protected against discrimination and hate crimes. Additionally, traditional forms of protest for Queer Rights such as organized public protest, government criticism, blockades, and marches most affiliated with the New York Gay Rights movement are not legal nor transposable within the Russian state or context. Since 2014, protests, freedom of assembly without government officials' expressed approval have been criminalized and punishable in Russia. 

Additionally, in 2013 Russia passed a "gay propaganda" law that acts as a political arm to suppress gay rights, education, and community online and physically. Members of parliament argue that the objective of the law is to "protect children" from finding information unnatural and immoral people and simultaneously champion "tradtional" family values and structures. 


However, Russian creatives have found a loophole to these laws through international social media giants such as Instagram as a way to network across borders, organizations with the capacity to attract thousands of people. Moreover, social media does not follow the same political lines or organizations; this allows the collaboration and networking between cultural leaders, artistic creatives, political activists, and the unassociated queer population to connect on the commonality of queer. 

As pop and EDM culture and the age of television and the internet popularized, the ability to find queer iconographies and symbols across Russia has never been more accessible and, most crucial, transportable across borders and language barriers. Artists (while not queer) like Russian pop duo T.aT.u and 2007 Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Verka Serduchka have become transnational icons of queerness transnationally despite neither being queer. Russian pop duo T.aT.u Lena Katina and Julia Volkova released the Queer cult classic "All the Things She Said" in 2002, rising in the charts and landing their late-night debut on the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.

"All the Things She Said" became a queer anthem accompanied by nearly pornographic performances while singing live and queer baiting in the music video. However, despite Katin and Volkova being heterosexual and anti-LGBTQ, they have become complicated international queer cult legends in both Russia and America, spurring conversations on rights and freedom in both countries in a time where queer visibility in mainstream media was a rare sight and only a few years following Ellen coming out. Vice journalist Daisy Jones sums up the complicated status of "All the Things She Said" as a facilitator of queer mobile zones and world-making writing, 

#### "I'm imbuing "All the Things She Said" with an excessive sentimentality here. Honestly, listen back to it now – it fucking slaps – and it also offered us actual queer girls the opportunity to reframe a marketing ploy into something powerful in the process – in spite of Volkova's blatant, wince-worthy homophobia. And while this band are so far from being queer icons (please!), the post-Trump need for girls making out in the rain to the sound of some freaky rock-trance hybrid has never been greater. I, for one, am here for it." 

Similarily, Ukrainian Eurovision song contestant Verka Serduchka acted as a significant post soviet gay icon on an international stage. While the Eurovision Song Contest is known for its eccentricity and Camp, it functions as geopolitical state power identity politics stringing together the queer identity and politics across Europe. However, none is as recognizable as drag star Verka Serduchka, dressed in a sparking track suit and or stereotypical traditional babushka garb. Her large and comically artificial breasts and camp makeup make her a recognizable and popular queer icon. While not gay herself, Serduchka's song КИСС ПЛИЗ (Kiss Me) is an example of how media subverts anti-LGBTQ politics, essentially making its way into popular culture independent from heteronormative institutional powers as a queer counter-public balancing between power dynamic between public versus private. Her music video features Serduchka dressed in the classic tracksuit with a disco ball star on her head. Her breasts are comically large, followed by her character's babushka mother and surrounded by hot twinks. Serduchka sings "I need your dance" and "kiss me" against an EDM track surrounded by sweaty men in towels and floating cellphones. The song and music video are the definition of Camp, garnering over a million views on youtube. While Serduchka may be recognized as a queer icon in Russia and Ukraine, youtube has allowed her drag persona to be recognizable transnationally across language barriers, even making her way into American films, including Melissa McCarthy's "Spy." 

Today music and art continue to be at the forefront of subversive queer activism and the media's ability to mobilize queer counter-publics further domestically and transnationally. [АНГЕЛ УЛЬЯНОВ](https://www.instagram.com/angel_ulyanov/) (ANGEL ULYANOV)  music video for [Давай замутим](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NetBsW8hIok&ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%93%D0%95%D0%9B%D0%A3%D0%9B%D0%AC%D0%AF%D0%9D%D0%9E%D0%92) is an example of how media continues to "push against institutional powers and diversionary lines explores the power dynamic between public versus private sex acts that develop based on relationships, cultures, and communities only recognized in intimate and close queer communities separate from any relation to domestic spaces, collective nationhood, and property" (Berlant & Warner, 558). Like Verka Seduchka, the music video for Давай замутим illustrates the complex dynamic between public versus private and the relationship between queer count-publics and nationhood. Various motifs of Russian pop culture are represented in the video, from the shaved heads to the tracksuit, while queer zones and aesthetics are simultaneously depicted. In addition, the video features voguing and scenes that make reference to ballroom culture. The camp imagery may be influenced by Western Queer culture; however, the music video illustrates a uniquely Russian experience of a Queer counter-public in today's Moscow. 

Furthermore, Давай замутим illustrates the complex dynamic between the public and private in mobile Queer zones amongst the Queer people who exist and operate within it. While he vogues in public, the voguing dancer's experience with the music and its connection with his body is made so in private; his headphones on create a second private queer zone within a mobile queer zone. He dances for an audience; despite his clothing representing a heteronormative style in Russia, his dance indicates his place within the Queer community, a sort of audition for validity and space within the counter-public.
