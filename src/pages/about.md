description: "Out of the Periphery: Queer Aesthetic and Community in Soviet Russia" 
---
#### Queerness in Russia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw intense changes in laws, freedom of movement and expression. Additionally, these rapid changes led to significant shifts in cultural attitudes and social and medical reforms surrounding gender expression, transgender and gender studies, and acknowledgement under both laws and society. From Romanov, Lenin, Stalin, and the fall of the USSR, Queerness survived in Russia on similar subversive aesthetic lines to the media loopholes we see contemporary queer communities use today on sites such as Instagram and Twitter. Russia's relationship to Queerness is a long and contentious history from the Lenin's leftist legalizations and the conservative crackdowns of conservative Stalinist governments; queer communities survived on the peripheries of society, building communities around the fashion coding and aesthetic. 
 
### Queerness in Russia from the Fall of the Romanovs to the Rise of Lenin

As discussed by Dan Healy in "Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: the Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent," Healy argues that homosexuality in Russia pre-revolutionary Russia offered more unofficial freedoms than its counterparts in Europe despite its illegal status. Furthermore, he argues that the criminalization of homosexuality is an "imported" law from other parts of Europe by Peter the Great. Under Peter, the Great sodomy (homosexuality) would be outlawed only amongst military men. Still, homosexuality would remain as a de facto legal status due to no law referencing the general public. It was only in 1835 that homosexuality in the general public (men only) became illegal. 

In Imperial Russia, "all sexuality was regarded with suspicion as a source of impurity." Sodomy was responded with formal penalties, and consensual male same-sex relations, not implicating anal penetration, were deemed no worse than masturbation (Healy). Michel Foucault blames the development of capitalism and utilitarianism as significant components of the West's regulation, medicalization, and suppression of homosexuality, writing, "it becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order" (Foucault, 6). Russia in the 19th century saw very little capitalist growth remaining an agricultural and largely landlord-based system, unlike the industrially growing West, maintaining traditional boundaries and system of society dating back from the 15th century. The 19th century maintained traditional demographics and power systems, with the majority of Russia's population being peasants and serfs, with gentry Landlords holding almost all the power. Healy explores the power Landlords held and their patriarchal role amongst his tenant's sexual relationships that, in some cases, this power dynamic developed into a patron-client sexual hierarchy writing "same-sex eros between males occurred in these enviroments and reflected their characteristics patterns of domination and subordination" (Healy, 22). This patron-client relationship existed everywhere, from exploiting young men for alcohol, cab driver supplementing incomes, teacher apprentice relationships and mutual masturbation with servants. However, nowhere was the patron-client relationship more prevalent and survived the longest than in the bathhouse. 

The bathhouse, since the 1700s, has been a place of sexual indulgence and exploration, later becoming the center of a queer social community. As medicalization and suppression of sexuality grew, Russian psychiatrists as a space full of prostitution and cruising culture (Healy, 27). The bathhouse functioned under a hierarchical system from patrons to senior servants and junior servants at the bottom. Clothing or lack of clothing denoted one's position in this hierarchy; young junior attendants tended to wear traditional Russian shirts while senior assistants worked in the nude (Healy, 181). Additionally, whether dressed or not, attendants followed a specific aesthetic uniform; beardless youthful attendants staffed bathhouses. Healy states this aesthetic tradition dates back to the 1700s, developed from Russia's patron-client structure. This is evidenced by a seventeenth-century miniature portrait depicting four beardless male youth attendants serving male bathhouse traditions (Healy, 26). 

Towards the end of the 19th-century, Bathhouses, despite beings popular sights for cruising and male prostitution, went largely unbothered, with even prolific members of the Imperial family frequenting them for cruising. For example, in the private journals of Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia (1858-1915), despite marrying young and producing nine children, Constantine was undeniably bisexual; his diaries confessed his affairs with young men and his frequent trips to a male bathhouse/brothel in St. Petersburg, a popular space for cruising, and the inner turmoil he felt for doing so. Typical of traditional hierarchal Bathhouse culture,  Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich found a relationship with a young bathhouse attendant writing about their affair frequently and the turmoil he anguished over having "sinned."

### Queer Aesthetic and Community from Lenin to Stalin's Soviet Russia
Lenin's rise to power saw a small window in time for Queerness to be legalized and thrive, moving more and more out of the periphery and into the mainstream Moscow and St Petersburg (Petrograd/Leningrad). Finally, following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, homosexuality was defacto legalized by abolishing all imperial laws and governance. While legal, homosexuals under Bolshevik governments were still under threat and discriminated against. Through fashion and coding, Gay men in Russia developed a distinct underground community and language. Looks included red ties or shawls sewn into back pockets and powered faces with heavy mascara. However, this coding was not universal amongst homosexual counter-public and subcultures. Like the bathhouses during the late 18th century, class hierarchy separated homosexual communities into two distinct categories, the rich, the last echos of the fashionable aristocratic nobility class before the revolution, and the poor, the unfashionable working class including soldiers and "ordinary" people. Magnus Hirschfeld, a German scientist, indirectly and directly influenced the Bolsheviks. He founded the Institute of Sexology in Berlin, and his publication "The Third Sex" translated into Russian only a few years after its initial publication in German.  

However, Healy argues to a certain extent, despite the later medicalization of homosexuality under the Bolshevik government, Lenin took a utilitarian approach to sex and suxeuality; considering sex, whether hetero or homo, to be a private affair and sex for pleasure a sacrifice devoted revolutionaries should make. Healy writes, 

#### "Lenin seemed to be saying that those who suffered from a “personalabnormality . . . in sexual life” ought to do so in silence while working for the revolution. Indulging in transgressive sexual behavior was“really quite bourgeois,” while seeking the sympathy of middle-classmorality was capitulation to the enemy. For the young “queer subject” imagined by Ushakovskii in 1908, the Lenin of 1920, refracted through the even more conservative mood of 1924, proposed an existence of sacriﬁce of the “personal” to the revolutionary movement (Healy, 113)."

While homosexuality was tolerated for a short period, conservative movements under Stalin in the 1930s saw the re-criminalization of homosexuality in Russia in the new Criminal Code of 1934. The hierarchal system of homosexuality of two counter publics offering two distinct mobile communities and freedoms came to an end; the aristocratic artistic homosexual community was not exempt from the brutal crackdown. As Stalin's crackdowns took form, so did the penalties for homosexuality; one year before the official criminalization of homosexuality saw the arrest and imprisonment of approximately 175 Gay men in July of 1933. The case continues to be classified; however, most men were charged and imprisoned in the Gulags, sentenced to hard labour, not for homosexuality but bad morality, counter-revolutionary espionage, into-social behaviours, and the corruption of corruption the Red Army. 

Generally, these stringent anti-homosexuality laws remained intact until the 1980s. Some slight movements to decriminalize consensual sodomy in the criminal code in 1959 made waves amongst a jurist committee however was overwhelmingly unsupported by the majority and crushed quickly. Homosexuality continued to function in subversive mobile counter-publics through bathhouse culture, fashion coding, and discrete cruising persisted against the harsh crackdowns and KGB. In the 1980s, under Gorbachov's government, Gay rights and activism discussion on the decriminalization of homosexuality grew. Gorbachov, until his predecessors, welcomed specific discussion and criticism of the Russian Soviet government in addition to the opening of the Soviet Union. Gorbachov's government permitted the first gay rights activist group to operate in addition to their magazine "Tema." Under his government, the first Mcdonald's opened in Moscow in January 1990. However, it was not until Boris Yeltsin in 1993 that homosexuality was legalized.

## Global Site Data and .env

As noted in the [Quick Start](/#quickstart), there are global site data variables in `src/_data/meta.json`.

Those include:

- `url` - should remain unchanged, reads from the single expected `.env` value of `URL`
- `siteName` - your "brand" if you will, appended to the `<title>` tag, shown in the `sitenav`, displayed in the "hero" for the `home` layout, in the footer by the copyright, as the "credit" for social share images, and as the identifier throughout the RSS feed
- `siteDescription` - used in the "description" meta tag, and below the `siteName` on the `home` layout
- `authorName` - Used in the RSS feed, intended to be your full name
- `twitterUsername` - without the "@", this value is used for the Twitter meta tags, and for the URL of the icon link in the footer

### .env

See `.env-sample` for the single expected value of `URL` which should be set to your localhost. The sample uses the default 11ty port, so you can simply rename the file to `.env` if you haven't changed the port.

The `URL` value is then available via the global data described previously, and can be used in templates with `meta.url`. You can see this used for the RSS feed and sitemap as well as meta tag links to the social share preview images to create the absolute URLs.

## Template Languages Used

Page templates are created as Nunjucks (`.njk`), and feature are added that expect Markdown for most page content.

The home page - `src/index.njk` - is set to process first as Markdown followed by Nunjucks. This allows mixing HTML with Markdown, with benefits being code syntax highlighting and ability to include classes on HTML elements. This functionality is provided by the `templateEngineOverride: md, njk` in the frontmatter.

A unique case uses Nunjucks to create the `json` that is used to generate the [social share preview images](#social-share-preview-images).

Review the list of [available templating languages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/) in the 11ty docs.

## Layout Hierarchy and Features

There are two layouts and one partial included.

**New in v1.1.0** - layouts are customized to be located in `src/_layouts`.

- `_layouts/base.njk` includes the standard HTML boilerplate including meta and "og" tags in `<head>`.

- `_layouts/page.njk` includes the `sitenav.njk` partial and chains up to `base`

The `src/index.njk` template chains to the `base` layout and includes a loop that will create "cards" for everything in `collections.pages`.

## Expected Frontmatter

There are only two fields expected:

- `title` - essentially required, by default is used in the page `<title>`, in the layout "hero", in social share preview images, and in social share meta tags.
- `description` - optional, by default appears below the title for the `page` template and is used as for the "description" meta tag and social share meta tag descriptions.

## Permalink Style

The default setup expects content - using any template language - within `pages/`.

The `pages.json` in that directory includes a `permalink` setting so that the file name is used directly to prevent 'pages' being the base of the URL.

You can [override permalinks per file](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/).

## Asset Handling

In the `.eleventy.js` config, there are included "pass-throughs" for an `img/` directory as well as `favicon.png`.

You can replace the included favicon, and create an `img` directory or remove the `addPassthroughCopy` if you do not have need of images.

Creating an `img` directory and keeping the pass-through directive will make images available at `/img/[image-file-path]` relative to the site root.

## Linting

For Sass, [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) is included. If you want to keep it, you may want to do a find/replace for `tdbc` to the prefix of your choice. If not, you'll want to remove the related files at the project root as well as the related items in the `package.json`.

A `prettier` config is included, with the only update being `printWidth: 100`.

## Sass Framework

Review the [styling documentation](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/) for the included minimal Sass framework, particularly the theme variables, to quickly customize the starter.

The only notable differences are:

1. `sitenav` - adjust the styles for the navigation header that appears on pages
1. `tdbc-anchor` - styles for the `#` anchor that appears next to page headings ([or turn that feature off](#anchor-links)) can be adjusted in `sass/_utilities`
1. Additional `article`-scoped styling for typography as it appears on `pages`
1. A theme for the [`prism` syntax highlighting](#prism-syntax-highlighting) for code blocks. You can adjust or replace the theme in `sass/_prism`.

### Fonts

The default font is [Baloo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+2) and is locally hosted with files in `fonts/`. If you swap to a different font, be sure to remove the font files as well as the `@font-face` rules at the top of `sass/_fonts.scss`, and update the `$tdbc-font-family` Sass variable.

## Anchor Links

Anchor links next to headings throughout Markdown content are generated by an add-on plugin for `markdownIt`.

This feature can be adjusted or removed in the `.eleventy.js` config file.

## Generated Features

### Sitemap

A `sitemap.xml` is generated from all available content.

To exclude non-page or non-public content from the sitemap, include `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true` in frontmatter, or [create a custom filter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#advanced-custom-filtering-and-sorting).

### RSS Feed

An RSS feed is included, and output at `[siteurl]/feed/feed.xml`.

If publishing from Netlify, the included `netlify.toml` file will create a redirect so that the feed becomes available at `[siteurl]/feed`.

### Social Share Preview Images

Upon use of the build command, social share preview images are generated for each page + the home page, and available in `docs/previews/[title-as-slug].png`.

Here's an example of the default template:

![default social share preview image template](/previews/hello-world.png)

As of v0.5.0, these images now use my Eleventy plugin - `@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-social-images` - with the default blue theme and a customized template.

Any changes made can be previewed by running the build command and reviewing the contents of `docs/previews/`.

[Review the plugin docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-social-images) for the full details of how to customize the behavior, and read on to learn how this starter is currently setup for the social images.

#### Update social image template HTML

HTML can be changed in `_generate/socialtemplate.njk` - be sure to leave the `<style>` block and the template tag within so that the plugin can insert your styles.

The only requirement for the generator to work is to keep an `<h1>` to populate with the content title, but the rest of the template is up to you!

#### Update social image template style

There are two options:

1. Select a different theme to use from the plugin's [predefined theme options](https://github.com/5t3ph/eleventy-plugin-social-images/tree/main/themes) and amend the `social-images` script to set the `--theme` option
2. Create a custom stylesheet (such as social.scss) and add the included `build:sass-social` script at the end of the `build:sass` command

If choosing to create your own styles for option #2, the CSS will be output in `social/style.css` with provided stubbed out script. You will need to add this as the value for the `--stylesPath` option within the `social-images` script to ensure your custom styles are used.

#### Change included pages OR available data

Adjust the collections loop in `_generate/pagesjson.njk`, but keep the defined keys of `title` and `imgName`.

## Prism Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting of inline or code blocks found within Markdown content is provided by Prism via `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight`.

You can change the theme used in `sass/_prism.scss`.

Or, remove the plugin if you are not in need of code highlighting.

## .eleventy.js Config Features

### Overrides

- **Input directory**: `src`
- **Output directory**: `docs`
- **Layout directory**: `_layouts`

Also, `markdownLibrary` is extended to add the `markdownItAnchor` plugin for [anchor links](#anchor-links).

### Shortcode: `year`

Returns the current `YYYY` year, used by the footer copyright.

### Filter: `slug`

Makes the default `slug` function more strict to ensure things like excluding emojis and enforcing lowercase.

## VSCode Tips

### Nunjucks

If you haven't previously worked with Nunjucks, you will want a syntax highlighting extension: [Nunjucks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ronnidc.nunjucks)

In addition, you may want to ensure Emmet works on `.njk` files by updating/adding the following in the `settings.json`:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
	"nunjucks": "html",
},
```

### Formatting

As noted previously, a `prettier` config is included, and you may want to get the
Prettier extension and update your VSCode settings to "Format on Save".

However, to format template files Prettier doesn't recognize like `.njk`, you can update the "Language Mode" on the currently open file from "Nunjucks" (or other current templating language) to "HTML" to allow formatting to be applied. Then, flip it back to re-allow the syntax highlighting if needed.

This is located in the VSCode bottom toolbar near the right-hand side and will display the value of the current file's detected language. Click the name to open the selector.

### Colophon

this starter kit was originally written by Stephanie Eckles - @5t3ph on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/5t3ph), [Github](https://github.com/5t3ph), [CodePen](https://codepen.com/5t3ph), and [DEV](https://dev.to/5t3ph). 

Here's what she has to say about herself:

> I spent a decade creating WordPress themes and plugins then flipped to product development + leading development of a multi-platform enterprise design system. My intro to Jamstack was with Gatsby, but 11ty fills a special place that is so needed for truly static sites. I'm in love, and I think you will be, too.
