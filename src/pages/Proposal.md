## Topic Description 
This project will explore how Eastern European indie fashion designers and queer rave subcultures generate an international queer revolution using public forums such as Instagram. I will be primarily be looking at Russian and Ukrainian fashion and their impact on sites like Instagram, I-D, and Vogue. Additionally, I would like to create 2-3 pages including traditional academic information/theory. A second page prioritizes Instagrams, articles, and websites links to different fashion brands. And a third comparative page that has a timeline of different Queer Fashion revolutions from the early years of vogue, the queer liberation movement, to contemporary Eastern Europe.

## Audience
The intended audience for this project is Queer youth who are interested in fashion, activism, and rave/EDM culture. I believe while this project focuses on the experiences of queer Ukrainians and Russians, this material can be consumable by people regardless of their geographical location. The Calvert Journal (a resource I will draw on regularly) supports this argument. While the journal focuses on eastern Europe, it is available internationally through digital publications. In addition, the journal is published in English and written by journalists from all over eastern Europe. Therefore, I don't feel there will be a serious language barrier with the project. 

## Structure Outline
 The website will have one main page structurally and be broken up into three sub-pages. The main page will hold the about/introduction information, information about myself (possibly), some images, and a brief overview of what the rest of the website holds. 
 - The first sub-page will hold my thesis and a more traditional academic exploration. It will analyze the data and support the thesis introduced on the main page.   
 - The second sub-page will house images and external digital media such as Instagram posts journal and magazine entries. This page will also be full of links to the different fashion houses mentioned in the first sub-page.
 - The Third sub-page will again be a writing heavy page about Queer communities and right in Soviet Russia

### Contemporary Fashion, Art and Activism: Uniting a Community Across Lines 
Although Queerness itself, such as sexuality, has not been criminalized since 1993 in Russia and 1991 in Ukraine, homosexuality, Queerness, and queer culture have largely disapproved, ostracized, policed and punished by the Russian and Ukrainian communities. 

Within Russian same-sex couples and families are not privy to the same social services, legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples. For example, the state does not recognize marriage between same-sex couples, nor are LGBTQ individuals protected against discrimination and hate crimes. Additionally, traditional forms of protest for Queer Rights such as organized public protest, government criticism, blockades, and marches most affiliated with the New York Gay Rights movement are not legal nor transposable within the Russian state or context. Since 2014, protests, freedom of assembly without government officials' expressed approval have been criminalized and punishable in Russia. 

Additionally, in 2013 Russia passed a "gay propaganda" law that acts as a political arm to suppress gay rights, education, and community online and physically. Members of parliament argue that the objective of the law is to "protect children" from finding information unnatural and immoral people and simultaneously champion "tradtional" family values and structures. 


However, Russian creatives have found a loophole to these laws through international social media giants such as Instagram as a way to network across borders, organizations with the capacity to attract thousands of people. Moreover, social media does not follow the same political lines or organizations; this allows the collaboration and networking between cultural leaders, artistic creatives, political activists, and the unassociated queer population to connect on the commonality of queer. 

### Out of the Periphery: Queer Aesthetic and Community in Soviet Russia
Queerness survived in soviet Russia on similar subversive aesthetic lines to the media loopholes contemporary queer communities use today. Russia's relationship to Queerness is a long and contentious history from the Lenin's leftist legalizations and the conservative crackdowns of conservative Stalinist governments; queer communities survived on the peripheries of society, building communities around the fashion coding and aesthetic. In Soviet Russia, fashion became a central figure in finding safety and hierarchy in queer communities, policing and suppressing Queerness, and validating Queerness through its medicalization.

As discussed by Dan Healy in "Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: the Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent," in Orthadox regulated Russia, "all sexuality was regarded with suspicion as a source of impurity." Sodomy was responded with formal penalties, and consensual male same-sex relations, not implicating anal penetration, were deemed no worse than masturbation. The regulation of homosexual desire only became a focus once the Western powers began to focus on sexual medicalization (Healy, 22). As the study of sexuality grew in the West, Nicholas I decreed the prohibition of sodomy in the entire Russian population to "instill relgious sensibilities and civic virtues that Russian males apparently lacked" (Healy, 22). Michel Foucault explains that the West's (and, in extension, Russia's) new relationship with sexuality and Sex is rooted in the Christian tradition of confession and the sin of the flesh. Foucault states, "A twofold evolution tended to make the flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings —so difficult to perceive and formulate—of desire. For this was an evil that afflicted the whole man, and in the most secret of forms " (Foucault, 19).

Michel Foucault blames the development of capitalism and utilitarianism as significant components of the West's regulation, medicalization, and suppression of homosexuality, writing, "it becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order. The minor chronicle of Sex and its trials is transposed into the ceremoni­ous history of the modes of production; its trifling aspect fades from view" (Foucault, 6). Sex for pleasure is no longer compatible; reproduction becomes the "only" motivator " sex became a "police" matter—in the full and strict sense given the term at the time: not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization of collective and individual forces." (Foucault, 24-26).
