## Background 

This project was conceived in 2021 and my participation in Hacking History (HIS498gave me the opportunity to treat this idea as a serious study in the Digital Humanities. 

Hacking History equipped with the foundation knowledge in technology, data, to begin to think, plan, and develop projects for the Digital Humanities. 

The current stage of the project is exploratory and experimental. 

## Inspiration

For many Canadians, the concept of reconciliation is a matter of government policy. Fortunately, the movement towards reconciliation recieves ample news coverage and we can now see businesses and institutiions introduce ways to include indigenous lives into their work and operational cultures. These are important and necessary moves, but I wonder what the 'average' Canadian can do, on a human level, to connect with thier own past and make connections with indigenous commmunities.
